Hi, I’m Anthony, and I am currently studying Information Systems, with a focus on Statistics, at Macquarie University in NSW. I enjoy working with numbers and transforming them into visuals that everyone can understand.

When I step away from screens and datasets, I’ll probably be playing piano or hopping between cozy cafes hunting for the perfect cup of coffee.

I plan to add more details and posts in the future. For now, feel free to explore my site and see what it has to offer!
