Hi, I’m Anthony, currently studying Information Systems with a minor in Statistics at Macquarie University of NSW. I enjoy working with data and visualizing that data into a very digestible one; also numbers scare me but I like them.

When I step away from screens and datasets, I’ll probably be playing piano or hopping between cozy cafes hunting for the perfect cup of coffee.

I’ll be adding more details about me someday — for now, feel free to explore my site and posts!
