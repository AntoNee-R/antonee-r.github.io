    "text": "2 Introduction\nObstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repetitive pauses in breathing due to upper airway obstruction. These interruptions lead to sleep fragmentation, hypoxia, and increased cardiovascular risk. Understanding physiological predictors of OSA severity is essential for developing effective screening and prevention strategies.\nIn this study, the arousal index (ai); representing the frequency of awakenings per hour, is used as the dependent variable. Four predictors are considered based on their known associations with OSA:\nBody Mass Index (BMI) – a general indicator of body fat.\nNeck Size – reflects airway obstruction potential.\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP) – captures cardiovascular strain.\nAge – accounts for physiological changes increasing OSA risk.\nThe study provides insights into how physiological and demographic factors correlate with sleep disturbances, helping guide further research and clinical screening in the context of OSA.\nMy goal here is to determine which of these variables significantly predict ai and to assess the overall performance and appropriateness of the regression model.\nFind the data here."

This correlation indicates that both variables are related to body composition.\n\n\n\n3.2 Model Fitting and Interpretation\nFitting the linear regression model using ai as the response variable and the other variables as the predictor.\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = ai ~ bmi + neck_size + sbp + age, data = sleep)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          bmi    neck_size          sbp          age  \n  -0.159406    -0.009852     0.040627     0.010218     0.008789  \n\n\nSignificant predictors (p &lt; 0.05) included neck size, sbp, and age, whereas bmi was not statistically significant.\n\n\n3.2.1 Producing a 95% CI that quantifies the change in ai for each extra cm of neck size:\nConfidence Interval at \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 or 95%\n\n\n               2.5 %     97.5 %\nneck_size 0.01248892 0.06876571\n\n\nTherefore, for every 1 cm increase in neck size, the arousal index (ai) increases by between 0.012 and 0.068 on the log scale, with 95% confidence, assuming age and sbp are held constant.\nThis provides strong evidence that neck size is an important risk factor for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity, as measured by the frequency of arousal during sleep.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 F-test For The Overall Regression\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = ai ~ bmi + neck_size + sbp + age, data = sleep)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.67136 -0.32269  0.01491  0.35778  1.47595 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

This indicates that at least one of the predictors is significantly related to the response variable.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Null Distribution for the test statistic\nUnder the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with 4 and 117 degrees of freedom.\nWhen \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\beta_3 = \\beta_4 = 0\\), then test statistic is F ~ F(4,117).\n\n\n\n3.2.7 P-value\nThe corresponding P-value for this overall regression model is:\n\\[\\text{p-value} = 9.54 \\times 10^{-7}\\]\n(or \\(0.000000954\\))\nP-value was previously calculated aforementioned above.\n\n\n\n3.2.8 Findings\nStatistical Conclusion:\nAs the p-value from the overall F-test is extremely small (\\(9.54 \\times 10^{-7}\\)), that is below the significance level (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)), we reject the null hypothesis that none of the predictors (bmi, neck_size, sbp, age) are related to the response variable.\nContextual Conclusion:\nThere is strong evidence that at least one of the predictors is significantly associated with the arousal index (ai). Thus, this overall regression model as a whole provides quite meaningful explanatory power for predicting ai.\nIn plain terms, the model isn’t random; there’s a clear relationship between OSA severity and the selected body measurements.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Model Validation & Appropriation\nChecking residual vs fitted plots for linearity and constant variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals are generally evenly scattered around the horizontal line at 0, which supports the assumption of linearity. While there is no distinct shape or pattern there is a slight upward curve on the right.\nAdditionally, there are a few outliers present, at points 68, 69, and 79; however, they do not demonstrate excessive influence.\nChecking the normality of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized qqplot shows that the residuals mostly follow the normal line, with very slight deviations at the tails. This implies that the normality assumptions are met, with no major concerns about non-normality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Based on these diagnostic checks, the full multiple regression model appears appropriate for explaining the variability in the arousal index (ai).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 \\(R^2\\) and It’s Significance\n\n\n[1] 0.221317\n\n\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\) = 0.2213. This is quite a low value, it means that in this model only about 22% of the variability is caused by the predictor variables, the other 78% is due to other factors not included or complete randomness.\nThis is not a good model, unreliable, and needs work."

    "text": "5.1 Organizations – Healthcare Institutions, Biotech & Pharma\nHealthcare organizations, including pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, face significant challenges in the era of quantum computing. For pharmaceutical firms, sensitive molecular and genomic data, as well as proprietary trial results, are at risk of quantum decryption attacks, raising ethical concerns about unauthorized access to unpublished drug formulas(Alif, 2024). To ensure compliance with FDA and EMA data protection regulations, these companies must transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and establish robust audit trails for clinical trial submissions. As quantum computing progresses, its impact on cybersecurity and data integration becomes increasingly crucial. Findings emphasize the application of quantum encryption techniques, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), to protect sensitive patient data from quantum-enabled cyberattacks. (Fairburn, 2025)\nTheoretical proposals have suggested the development of Quantum Universal Exchange Languages (QUEL) to improve interoperability between quantum and classical systems, enabling seamless data sharing in multi-centre clinical trials. Moreover, quantum-assisted resource allocation frameworks have shown promise in enhancing hospital workflows, such as dynamically managing operating room schedules and optimizing patient triage processes in real time."
